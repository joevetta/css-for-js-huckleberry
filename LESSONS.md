# Lessons Learned

After watching the solutions video, here are some take-aways.

- Login to Figma to get accurate numbers/measurements/colors.
- Pay attention to the scale values given in the README instead of getting close by comparing scaled anonymous-view Figma side-by-side to in-progress solution
- Pay attention to readability concerns when deciding to use px or rem units for margin
- Class name max-width-wrapper should have been obvious in its intent, but I didn't end up using it that. I think when I first started I was expecting some trickery with the left-shifted card header similar to the exercise where we made an otter image push beyond its container's left/right padding
